# List installed packages
leaf list

# Search for packages
leaf search editor

# Remove a package
leaf remove nvim

# Update package list
leaf update
```

## Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `leaf install <package>` | Install a package | `leaf install ripgrep` |
| `leaf remove <package>` | Remove an installed package | `leaf remove ripgrep` |

## Available Packages

### Editors & IDEs
- `nvim` - Neovim text editor
- `helix` - Modern modal text editor
- `code` - Visual Studio Code

*Use `leaf search .` to see all available packages.*

## How It Works

1. **User-space installation**: All packages are installed in `~/.local/leaf/packages/`
2. **Automatic PATH management**: Executables are symlinked to `~/.local/bin/`
3. **Smart extraction**: Supports `.tar.gz`, `.tar.xz`, and `.zip` archives
4. **Metadata tracking**: Each installation is tracked with version and file information
5. **Clean removal**: Removes all files and symlinks when uninstalling

## Directory Structure

```
~/.local/leaf/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/           # Installed packages
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nvim/          # Package directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/             # Downloaded archives
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json        # Leaf configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packages.json      # Package definitions

~/.local/bin/          # Executable symlinks (added to PATH)
```

## Configuration

Leaf stores its configuration in `~/.local/leaf/config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "install_dir": "/home/user/.local/leaf",
  "bin_dir": "/home/user/.local/bin",
  "packages_dir": "/home/user/.local/leaf/packages",
  "cache_dir": "/home/user/.local/leaf/cache"
}
```

   {
     "package-name": {
       "description": "Package description",
       "url": "https://github.com/user/repo/releases/download/v1.0.0/binary.tar.gz",
       "version": "1.0.0",
       "type": "archive",
       "executables": "bin/executable-name",
       "tags": ["category", "tool"]
     }
   }
   ```
3. Submit a pull request

### Development

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf.git
   cd leaf
   ```

2. Build from source:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```

    ```bash
    cargo test
    ```
    this will check each package in the `packages.json` file and validate them.

## Requirements

- **Linux**: glibc 2.17+ (most distributions from 2012+)
- **macOS**: macOS 10.12+ (Sierra)
- **Architecture**: x86_64

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found after installation

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Permission denied when running installed packages

Some packages may need executable permissions:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/package-name
```

### Package not found

Update the package list:
```bash
leaf update
```
