## Quick Start

### Installation

#### Linux

Install Leaf with a single command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf/main/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`).

#### Windows

Install Leaf by running this command in a **PowerShell** terminal:

```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf/main/install.ps1 | iex
```

After installation, restart your PowerShell terminal for the `PATH` changes to take effect.

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Install a package
leaf install go

# List installed packages
leaf list

# Search for packages
leaf search editor

# Remove a package
leaf remove go

# Update the list of available packages
leaf update
```

## Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `leaf install <package>` | Install a package | `leaf install nvim` |
| `leaf remove <package>` | Remove an installed package | `leaf remove nvim` |
| `leaf list` | List all installed packages | `leaf list` |
| `leaf search <term>` | Search for available packages | `leaf search rust` |
| `leaf update` | Update package definitions from the registry | `leaf update` |
| `leaf self-update` | Update Leaf to the latest version | `leaf self-update` |
| `leaf nuke --confirmed`| **DESTRUCTIVE**: Remove all packages and Leaf itself | `leaf nuke --confirmed` |
| `leaf --help` | Show help information | `leaf --help` |

## How It Works

1.  **User-Space Installation**: Packages are installed into your user directory, not system-wide.
    -   **Linux**: `~/.local/share/leaf/packages/`
    -   **Windows**: `%LOCALAPPDATA%\leaf\packages\`
2.  **Automatic PATH Management**: Executables are linked into a common `bin` directory that you add to your PATH once.
3.  **Cross-Platform Awareness**: The `packages.json` registry contains different URLs and instructions for each operating system.
4.  **Clean Removal**: `leaf remove` deletes the package directory and its executable link, keeping your system clean.

## Directory Structure

**On Linux:**
```
~/.local/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ share/leaf/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/         # Installed packages
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/            # Downloaded archives
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json       # Leaf configuration
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packages.json     # Package definitions
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/                  # Executable symlinks (in your PATH)
```

**On Windows:**
```
%LOCALAPPDATA%\
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ leaf\
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/         # Installed packages
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/            # Downloaded archives
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json       # Leaf configuration
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packages.json     # Package definitions

# Note: Binaries are typically placed in a directory already in the user's PATH,
# or you will be instructed to add it.
```

### Adding New Packages

1.  Fork this repository.
2.  Edit `packages.json` to add or update a package. The new format requires a `platforms` object:
    ```json
    "package-name": {
      "description": "A cool tool.",
      "version": "1.2.3",
      "tags": ["cli", "tool"],
      "platforms": {
        "linux-x86_64": {
          "url": "https://.../download/v1.2.3/linux-amd64.tar.gz",
          "type": "archive",
          "executables": ["bin/executable"]
        },
        "windows-x86_64": {
          "url": "https://.../download/v1.2.3/windows-amd64.zip",
          "type": "archive",
          "executables": ["bin/executable.exe"]
        }
      }
    }
    ```
3.  Run `cargo test` to validate the URLs in your new entry.
4.  Submit a pull request!
