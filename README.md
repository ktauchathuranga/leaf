## Quick Start

### Installation

Install Leaf with a single command in your terminal. By default, the latest stable release is installed:

Using `curl`:
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf/main/install.sh | bash
```

Using `wget`:
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf/main/install.sh | bash
```

To install a specific version or prerelease:
```bash
# Install a specific stable version
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --version v1.2.3

# Install a specific prerelease version
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --version v1.2.3-beta

# Install the latest prerelease (alpha, beta, or rc)
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --prerelease
```

After installation, restart your terminal or run `source ~/.bashrc` (or `~/.zshrc`).

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Install a package
leaf install go

# List installed packages
leaf list

# Search for packages
leaf search editor

# Remove a package
leaf remove go

# Update the list of available packages
leaf update

# Update Leaf to the latest stable version
leaf self-update

# Update Leaf to a specific version
leaf self-update --version v1.2.3

# Update Leaf to the latest prerelease
leaf self-update --prerelease
```

## Commands

| Command | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| `leaf install <package>` | Install a package | `leaf install nvim` |
| `leaf remove <package>` | Remove an installed package | `leaf remove nvim` |
| `leaf list` | List all installed packages | `leaf list` |
| `leaf search <term>` | Search for available packages | `leaf search rust` |
| `leaf update` | Update package definitions from the registry | `leaf update` |
| `leaf self-update [--version <version>] [--prerelease]` | Update Leaf to the latest stable version, a specific version, or the latest prerelease | `leaf self-update`<br>`leaf self-update --version v1.2.3`<br>`leaf self-update --prerelease` |
| `leaf nuke --confirmed`| **DESTRUCTIVE**: Remove all packages and Leaf itself | `leaf nuke --confirmed` |
| `leaf --help` | Show help information | `leaf --help` |

## How It Works

1. **User-Space Installation**: Packages are installed into your user directory (`~/.local/leaf/packages/`), not system-wide.
2. **Automatic PATH Management**: Executables are linked into a common `bin` directory that you add to your PATH once.
3. **Clean Removal**: `leaf remove` deletes the package directory and its executable link, keeping your system clean.
4. **Version Control**: Use `--version` or `--prerelease` with `self-update` or the install script to control which version of Leaf is installed.

## Directory Structure

```
~/.local/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ bin/                  # Executable symlinks (in your PATH)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ leaf/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/         # Installed packages
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/            # Downloaded archives
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json       # Leaf configuration
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packages.json     # Package definitions
```

            }
          ]
        },
        "linux-aarch64": {
          "url": "https://.../download/v1.2.3/linux-arm64.tar.gz",
