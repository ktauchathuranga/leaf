## How It Works

1. **User-space installation**: All packages are installed in `~/.local/leaf/packages/`
2. **Automatic PATH management**: Executables are symlinked to `~/.local/bin/`
3. **Smart extraction**: Supports `.tar.gz`, `.tar.xz`, and `.zip` archives
4. **Metadata tracking**: Each installation is tracked with version and file information
5. **Clean removal**: Removes all files and symlinks when uninstalling

## Directory Structure

```
~/.local/leaf/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ packages/           # Installed packages
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ nvim/          # Package directory
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ cache/             # Downloaded archives
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.json        # Leaf configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ packages.json      # Package definitions

~/.local/bin/          # Executable symlinks (added to PATH)
```

## Configuration

Leaf stores its configuration in `~/.local/leaf/config.json`:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "install_dir": "/home/user/.local/leaf",
  "bin_dir": "/home/user/.local/bin",
  "packages_dir": "/home/user/.local/leaf/packages",
  "cache_dir": "/home/user/.local/leaf/cache"
}
```

## Requirements

- **Linux**: glibc 2.17+ (most distributions from 2012+)
- **macOS**: macOS 10.12+ (Sierra)
- **Architecture**: x86_64 or ARM64

## Troubleshooting

### Command not found after installation

Make sure `~/.local/bin` is in your PATH:
```bash
echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
```

### Permission denied when running installed packages

Some packages may need executable permissions:
```bash
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/package-name
```

### Package not found

Update the package list:
```bash
leaf update
```

## Migration from Python Version

If you're upgrading from the Python version of Leaf:

1. Remove the old installation:
   ```bash
   rm ~/.local/bin/leaf  # Remove old Python script
   ```

2. Install the new Rust version:
   ```bash
   curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ktauchathuranga/leaf/main/install.sh | bash
   ```

3. Your existing packages and configuration will be preserved.
